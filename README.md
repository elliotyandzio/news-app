# International News Project
I was given the task to create a news application that returned the top 5 headlines from a country selected by the user. The library that I chose to create the project was React.

## How to run the project
<ul>
    <li>run `npm install`</li>
    <li>run `npm run start` to run the project on http://locaslhost:3000</li>
</ul>

## Project Structure
The Logic(React Components) and the styling(SASS) were broken into four components, Country Selector, News, Article and the overall app component.

The Github has been broken down into a master and develop branch. A branch is created for each new feature which will be merged into the develop (and eventually the master) branch once it is completed.

The project has also been styled for desktop, tablet and mobile.
